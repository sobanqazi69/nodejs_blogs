# Railway Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Deploy Your News Scraper to Railway

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Railway account (free tier available)
- Your news scraper code

## Step 1: Prepare Your Repository

### 1.1 Push to GitHub
```bash
# Initialize git if not already done
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: News scraper with Railway support"

# Create GitHub repository and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/news-scraper.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 1.2 Verify Files
Make sure these files are in your repository:
- `railway.json` âœ…
- `Procfile` âœ…
- `package.json` âœ…
- `src/railway-app.js` âœ…
- `src/health.js` âœ…

## Step 2: Deploy to Railway

### 2.1 Create Railway Account
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Connect your GitHub account

### 2.2 Deploy Project
1. Click "New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose your news scraper repository
4. Railway will automatically detect it's a Node.js project

### 2.3 Configure Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, go to your project â†’ Variables tab:

```env
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=news.db
DB_PORT=3306

# Scraper Configuration
SCRAPE_INTERVAL_MINUTES=5
MAX_ARTICLES_PER_SCRAPE=0
ENABLE_STATUS_UPDATES=true
LOG_LEVEL=info
NODE_ENV=production

# Optional: Custom settings
SHOW_NEW_ARTICLES=true
SHOW_SCRAPE_PROGRESS=true
```

## Step 3: Database Setup

### Option A: SQLite (Recommended for Railway)
- No additional setup needed
- Database file will be created automatically
- Perfect for free tier

### Option B: MySQL (If you want external database)
1. Add MySQL service in Railway
2. Update environment variables with MySQL credentials
3. Change `DATABASE_TYPE=mysql`

## Step 4: Configure Cron Job

### 4.1 Railway Cron Jobs
Railway doesn't have traditional cron jobs, but the app runs continuously:

1. **Continuous Mode**: The app runs 24/7 and scrapes every 5 minutes
2. **Health Checks**: Railway monitors the app via `/health` endpoint
3. **Auto-restart**: Railway restarts the app if it crashes

### 4.2 Alternative: External Cron Service
If you want to use external cron service:

1. **Cron-job.org**: Free cron service
2. **Set URL**: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
3. **Interval**: Every 5 minutes
4. **Purpose**: Keep app alive and trigger scrapes

## Step 5: Monitor Your Deployment

### 5.1 Railway Dashboard
- **Deployments**: View deployment history
- **Logs**: Real-time application logs
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, network usage
- **Variables**: Environment variables

### 5.2 Health Check Endpoints
Your app will be available at: `https://your-app.railway.app`

- **Health Check**: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- **Stats**: `https://your-app.railway.app/stats`
- **Home**: `https://your-app.railway.app/`

### 5.3 View Logs
```bash
# In Railway dashboard, go to Deployments â†’ View Logs
# Or use Railway CLI:
railway logs
```

## Step 6: Custom Domain (Optional)

### 6.1 Add Custom Domain
1. Go to your project â†’ Settings â†’ Domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed

### 6.2 SSL Certificate
- Railway provides free SSL certificates
- Automatic HTTPS for all domains

## Step 7: Scaling and Optimization

### 7.1 Free Tier Limits
- **Build Time**: 500 minutes/month
- **Deploy Time**: 100 hours/month
- **Sleep**: App sleeps after 5 minutes of inactivity
- **Wake Time**: ~30 seconds to wake up

### 7.2 Pro Tier Benefits
- **Always On**: No sleep mode
- **More Resources**: Higher CPU/memory limits
- **Custom Domains**: Multiple domains
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple team members

## Step 8: Troubleshooting

### 8.1 Common Issues

#### App Not Starting
```bash
# Check logs in Railway dashboard
# Common causes:
# - Missing dependencies
# - Wrong start command
# - Environment variables not set
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# For SQLite: Check file permissions
# For MySQL: Verify connection string
# Check environment variables
```

#### Memory Issues
```bash
# Monitor memory usage in Railway dashboard
# Optimize scraper for lower memory usage
# Consider upgrading to Pro tier
```

### 8.2 Debug Commands
```bash
# Test locally with Railway environment
npm run railway

# Check health endpoint
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health

# View application logs
railway logs --follow
```

## Step 9: Advanced Configuration

### 9.1 Custom Build Process
```json
// railway.json
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "npm install && npm run build"
  }
}
```

### 9.2 Multiple Services
```json
// railway.json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "name": "web",
      "source": ".",
      "build": { "builder": "NIXPACKS" }
    },
    {
      "name": "scraper",
      "source": ".",
      "build": { "builder": "NIXPACKS" }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 10: Monitoring and Alerts

### 10.1 Railway Monitoring
- **Uptime**: Automatic monitoring
- **Alerts**: Email notifications for failures
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, network graphs

### 10.2 External Monitoring
